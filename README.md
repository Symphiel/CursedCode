# CursedCode
Cursed custom maps for CrossCode designed around speedrunning tricks. Go into the New Game Plus menu and select the CursedCode option before starting a new game. DO MAKE A SAVE IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING FUTURE VERSIONS.

To further emphasize, this mod does not change anything to how the game operates. It only adds in maps that require "bugs" that already exist in the base game. An exmaple of things to come: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiUTqWnf3PI

Made with [CrossCode Map Editor](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/crosscode-map-editor).

js code and packaging sourced from [Autumn's Genesis mod](https://github.com/Hsifnus/autumns-genesis).

I am a map maker, not a programmer.
